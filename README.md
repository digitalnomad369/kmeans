# System Objectives and Description
		
kmeans is a program aimed at implementing the k-means clustering algorithm on predefined datasets. 

To assist in the implementation of the k-means algorithm, functions were written to achieve the following:
- finding the Euclidean distance between two data points
- reading csv files 
- find the nearest centroid to each data point of all the centroid 
- visualizing the clusters

The program should output the following:
1. The number of countries belonging to each cluster
2. The list of countries belonging to each cluster
3. The mean Life Expectancy and Birth Rate for each cluster

# System Requirements and Installation 

As the program is coded in Python, in order to run and test the code, the following IDE is required:

__- The Python IDE:__
To download the Python IDE, click on the following link to access the official Python website: 
*https://www.python.org/downloads/*

Alternatively, you can download Visual Studio Code which also supports compatibility for Python code
